# OOP345 NAA, NBB and NRA Notes
## [Workshop Zero](WS00/readme.md)
As a student in my C++ course, you must familiarize yourself with GitHub so you can share your daily work with me for advice, help, collaboration, and monitoring of your progress.

## Mac Users
If you are working on a Mac, you are required to learn and work with Visual Studio as an advanced IDE, especially in future semesters. To use Visual Studio on a Mac, you can either do all the git commands through the command line and use XCode (which you cannot use in future Windows-related subjects), or you can install a Virtual Machine and run Windows on your Mac. This will have Windows running in a window on your Mac without losing your Mac settings and features.

Here are the steps to install Fusion Vmware and Windows 10 on Fusion VM:

- [Install Fusion Vmware](https://www.vmware.com/ca/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html). Fusion is free for students; click on ["Register License for Personal Use"](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal) 
- [Install Windows 10 on Fusion VM](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-custom-virtual-machine-vmware-fusion/)
