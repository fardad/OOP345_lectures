In C++, lock guards are mechanisms provided in the Standard Library to ensure proper management of mutex locks in multithreaded programs. They help prevent issues like deadlocks and resource leaks by automatically locking and unlocking a mutex, simplifying thread synchronization. Here's a brief overview of the main lock guards:

---

### **1. `std::lock_guard`**
- **Purpose**: Provides a simple and exception-safe way to lock a mutex.
- **Behavior**:
  - Acquires a lock on a given mutex when the `std::lock_guard` object is created.
  - Automatically releases the lock when the `std::lock_guard` object goes out of scope.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  std::mutex mtx;
  void safeFunction() {
      std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
      // Critical section
  } // Lock is released automatically here
  ```
- **Use Case**: Best for simple scenarios where a mutex lock is required for the scope of a function or block.

---

### **2. `std::unique_lock`**
- **Purpose**: Offers more flexibility than `std::lock_guard` by allowing deferred locking, manual unlocking, and re-locking.
- **Features**:
  - Can lock/unlock multiple times during its lifetime.
  - Supports deferred locking (e.g., the mutex is not locked immediately upon creation).
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  std::mutex mtx;
  void flexibleFunction() {
      std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx, std::defer_lock);
      // Mutex is not locked yet
      lock.lock(); // Manually lock the mutex
      // Critical section
      lock.unlock(); // Manually unlock the mutex
  }
  ```
- **Use Case**: Suitable for more complex scenarios requiring conditional locking or coordination with other locking mechanisms.

---

### **3. `std::scoped_lock`** (C++17 and later)
- **Purpose**: Provides a convenient way to manage multiple mutexes simultaneously to avoid deadlocks.
- **Behavior**:
  - Locks all provided mutexes when the `std::scoped_lock` is created.
  - Unlocks all mutexes automatically when the `std::scoped_lock` object goes out of scope.
  - Ensures the order of locking prevents deadlocks.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  std::mutex mtx1, mtx2;
  void safeMultiLock() {
      std::scoped_lock lock(mtx1, mtx2);
      // Critical section with both mutexes locked
  } // Both mutexes are released here
  ```
- **Use Case**: Best for scenarios requiring multiple mutex locks in a deadlock-safe manner.

### Summary
| Lock Guard       | Key Feature                            | When to Use                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `std::lock_guard` | Simple and efficient; no manual control | For straightforward, scoped locking               |
| `std::unique_lock`| Flexible; allows deferred/manual control| For complex locking scenarios                     |
| `std::scoped_lock`| Locks multiple mutexes safely          | For multi-mutex locking to prevent deadlocks      |

These tools streamline the process of managing mutexes and ensure thread safety with minimal risk of human error.
