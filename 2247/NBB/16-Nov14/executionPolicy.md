The `<execution>` header in C++17 introduces **execution policies** for controlling how certain Standard Library algorithms, such as `std::transform_reduce`, `std::sort`, `std::for_each`, etc., are executed. These policies provide options for sequential or parallel execution, allowing you to optimize performance depending on your requirements and hardware capabilities.

### Execution Policies in C++

The primary execution policies in C++ are:

1. **`std::execution::seq`** – Sequential execution
2. **`std::execution::par`** – Parallel execution
3. **`std::execution::par_unseq`** – Parallel and unsequenced execution

Let’s go through each one in detail.

---

### 1. `std::execution::seq` (Sequential Execution)

- **Description**: This policy specifies that the algorithm should be executed **sequentially**, meaning one element at a time, in the order they appear.
- **Use Case**: Use this policy if you want the algorithm to process elements in a single thread. It’s the default behavior if you don’t specify an execution policy.
- **Example**: Using `std::execution::seq` will make `std::for_each` iterate over elements sequentially.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <execution>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::for_each(std::execution::seq, data.begin(), data.end(), [](int &n) { n *= 2; });
    for (int n : data) std::cout << n << " ";
    return 0;
}
```

- **Output**: `2 4 6 8 10`

### 2. `std::execution::par` (Parallel Execution)

- **Description**: This policy allows the algorithm to execute in **parallel**, dividing work across multiple threads.
- **Use Case**: Use `std::execution::par` when you want to speed up computation-heavy operations on large data sets by leveraging multiple CPU cores.
- **Behavior**: The function does not guarantee any particular order of execution, so results may vary slightly depending on timing and concurrency.
- **Example**: Applying `std::execution::par` to `std::for_each` can allow each element to be processed in parallel.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <execution>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::for_each(std::execution::par, data.begin(), data.end(), [](int &n) { n *= 2; });
    for (int n : data) std::cout << n << " ";
    return 0;
}
```

- **Output**: Output will be the same values doubled, though the order might be unpredictable depending on thread execution.

### 3. `std::execution::par_unseq` (Parallel and Unsequenced Execution)

- **Description**: This policy allows **both parallel and vectorized execution** (unsequenced). It leverages parallelism across multiple threads and may use SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions for additional speedup on supported hardware.
- **Use Case**: Use `std::execution::par_unseq` when maximum performance is required, and you do not need any ordering guarantees. It’s particularly useful for computation-heavy operations over large data sets where the hardware supports SIMD.
- **Behavior**: Execution is neither ordered nor synchronized, which allows the compiler to apply optimizations like vectorization.
- **Example**: The example below uses `std::for_each` with `std::execution::par_unseq` to leverage parallelism and vectorization.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <execution>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::for_each(std::execution::par_unseq, data.begin(), data.end(), [](int &n) { n *= 2; });
    for (int n : data) std::cout << n << " ";
    return 0;
}
```

- **Output**: Like with `par`, the output values will be doubled, but the execution order might vary due to parallelism and SIMD operations.

### Summary of Execution Policies

| Execution Policy              | Execution Type                 | Order of Execution | Typical Use Case                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `std::execution::seq`         | Sequential                     | Ordered            | Simple tasks or when order matters     |
| `std::execution::par`         | Parallel                       | Unordered          | Large data sets needing faster processing |
| `std::execution::par_unseq`   | Parallel and Unsequenced       | Unordered          | High-performance tasks with SIMD support, where order is irrelevant |

### Choosing an Execution Policy

- Use `seq` for predictable, sequential processing.
- Use `par` for multi-threaded performance on multi-core processors.
- Use `par_unseq` for maximum performance, leveraging both multi-threading and SIMD, especially on hardware that supports vectorization.

> **Note**: `std::execution::par` and `std::execution::par_unseq` require a compiler and hardware support for parallel and vectorized execution to fully benefit from these policies.
